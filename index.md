# Help improve children's eyesight, even during virtual school.

*Everyone* can help!

## Children

- Let your eyes rest when using a computer. Every twenty minutes, look at a distance of twenty feet for twenty seconds. Every hour, take a ten-minute rest.
- Minimize screen time.
- Don't drag windows or dragable things around the screen very quickly. Things moving fast on the screen make your eyes tired.
- You would rather read an e-book than play a video game for your eyes.
- Don't read a book or look at a device held near to your eyes or lying on the ground.
- Your eyes will prefer black on white or white on black text than coloured text.

## Parents

Encourage your children to do the things above and moniter electronic usage.

## Teachers

Encourage your students to do the things above and let students have breaks.

- Assign more work offline like building science projects.
- It is better for your students' eyes to learn by completing documents than playing games.
