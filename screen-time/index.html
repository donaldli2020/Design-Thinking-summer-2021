		<h1>Help improve children's eyesight, even during virtual school.</h1>
		<p>
			<i>Everyone</i> can help!
		</p>
		<h2>Children</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Let your eyes rest when using a computer. Every twenty minutes, look at a distance of twenty feet for twenty seconds. Every hour, take a ten-minute rest.</li>
			<li>Minimize screen time.</li>
			<li>Don't drag windows or dragable things around the screen very quickly. Things moving fast on the screen make your eyes tired.</li>
			<li>You would rather read an e-book than play a video game for your eyes.</li>
			<li>Don't read a book or look at a device held near to your eyes or lying on the ground.</li>
			<li>Your eyes will prefer black on white or white on black text than coloured text.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Parents</h2>
		<p>Encourage your children to do the things above and moniter electronic usage.</p>
		<h2>Teachers</h2>
		<p>Encourage your students to do the things above and let students have breaks.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Assign more work offline like building science projects.</li>
			<li>It is better for your students' eyes to learn by completing documents than playing games.</li>
		</ul>
